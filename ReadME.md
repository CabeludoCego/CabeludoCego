Hello, you can call me @CabeludoCego. 
I'm currently a Electrical Eng. student and member of LASI-UFPI, a Intelligent Systems study group focused on impacting society! 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in learning more about Python technologies: Tensorflow, Django and databases. 
Plus I've got experience with C, Python, Matlab, some Web basic development and AI-based programs.
